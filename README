Introduction:

These are files I personally use to manage my domains and services on a Linode VPS.

I put effort into making them moderately generic enough to work for others, but have
not tested them in other environments. I use:

- PHP 5.3, with the php-fpm patch
- NGINX web server
- Ubuntu 9.10

Warning:

I classify myself as a poor system administrator but am learning this task as I now
spend time managing my own VPS. So, because of this, my scripts cannot guarantee
themselves as being #1 awesome.... You've been warned.
